# Image Processing Algorithms: Theory and Implementation
This is a course project of M 348: Scientific Computation in Numerical Analysis at the University of Texas at Austin.

We use MATLAB to increase the contrast of an image, rotate an image, and also perform compression using SVD truncation.

The problems that we aim to answer can be found at [problems.pdf.](https://github.com/lee-wei-xuan/image_processing_algorithms/blob/main/problems.pdf)

A detailed report can be found at [report.pdf.](https://github.com/lee-wei-xuan/image_processing_algorithms/blob/main/report.pdf)

Furthermore, the MATLAB scripts used can be found at [scripts.](https://github.com/lee-wei-xuan/image_processing_algorithms/tree/main/scripts)
